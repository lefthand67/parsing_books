Rot Front! This is a Python program that aimed on parsing the txt format books from Gutenberg Project to a PostgreSQL database.

If you want to try the program on your own, change the database credentials in the info.py file for yours.

Program is a part of my training on working with Postgres and psycopg 3. The author of the exercise's idea is Dr. Chuck Severance from his "PostgreSQL for everybody course"'s [Lesson 6](https://www.pg4e.com/lessons/week6a). Dr Chuck uses psycopg 2 module, I use the newest release on Python 3.12 (as of November 2023). Also, I try to write a working program that catches errors and is pretty readable by other programmers (I use main() function standard that helps to concentrate on the main operations in the upper half of the document while all the functions are written below it). I just learn and experiment.
